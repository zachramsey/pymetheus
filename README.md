***This package is in early development and subject to breaking changes!***

Currently, the project is in closed-development to elaborate upon testing, documentation, and design principles. Ultimately, the repository will be opened to public contribution once the groundwork is set. Until then, public feedback and suggestions are very much welcomed and appreciated!
