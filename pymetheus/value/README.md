# Value Function (Critic) Module

This module contains implementations of value functions, which estimate the expected attainable returns given a state for state-values or state-action pair for action-values (Q-values).

[value/base.py](./base.py) contains the abstract `Value` class, which defines the contract for interaction with value functions. All concrete implementations must subclass `Value` to ensure this contract is maintained.
