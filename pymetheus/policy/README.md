# Policy Function (Actor) Module

This module contains implementations of policy functions, which determine the action to take that maximizes returns given the environment state.

[policy/base.py](./base.py) contains the abstract `Policy` class, which defines the contract for interaction with policy functions. All concrete implementations must subclass `Policy` to ensure this contract is maintained.
